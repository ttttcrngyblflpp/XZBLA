# BXZRA

Melee input on keyboards with a Kinesis-Advantage-like layout for Linux.

Named after the buttons that the right hand home-row buttons map to in
order from pinky to thumb, BXRZA is a B0XX-inspired layout with the
philosophy of disregarding balance (no nerfs or buffs), and focusing on
simplicity and elegance.
